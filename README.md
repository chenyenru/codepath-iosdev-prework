### My App Idea
#### Description
**Title: Expiration Date Manager**

I would like to make an expiration date manager that keeps a library of all the items I'm using that will expire (for example, skincare products!) and give notifications when they will soon expire. It will manage all the items I have and allow users to add photos of these items. This will allow the user to know the exact item that the expiration alert is pointing to. 

#### User workflow
1. Take a pic of the thing or copy from the internet
2. Upload
4. Set notification date (optional)
5. Auto set notification dates
6. Set:
    1. Title
    2. Expiration Date
    3. object label
    4. location (optional)
    5. descriptions (optional)
